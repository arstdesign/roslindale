                  This sans serif font, created by David Jonathan Ross in 2017, was heavily inspired by the 19th century font, DeVinne, who the designer learned about after visiting the workshop of a collector of wood type paraphernalia. Ross wanted to create a typeface that could be simple and ornate at the same time. He reimagined DeVinne with his own vision, to be “plain and funky at once”. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Theodore Low DeVinne, a renowned printer, in 1888 reacting to newer more ornamental fonts from the time, wanted a more plain type that would go against what was popular at the time. He worked with the Central Type Foundry in St Louis, Missouri to have a font like that made. There, in 1890, the foundry named their new font after DeVinne. The creators of the font itself were Nicolas Werner and Gustav Schroder. Since its inception, DeVInne was used predominantly in advertising, coming back into style in the 1970s.
